Matplotlib Getting Started

Installation of Matplotlib

If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.
Install it using this command:

C:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed,  like Anaconda, Spyder etc.

Import Matplotlib

Once Matplotlib is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import module statement:

import matplotlib

Now Matplotlib is imported and ready to use:

Checking Matplotlib Version

The version string is stored under __version__ attribute.
"""

#Example

import matplotlib

print(matplotlib.__version__)

#Note: two underscore characters are used in __version__.
