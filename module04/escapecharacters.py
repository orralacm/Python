Python - Escape Characters

Escape Character

To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
"""

#Example
#You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
#txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

"""To fix this problem, use the escape character \":"""

txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt) 

"""Other escape characters used in Python:"""

txt = 'It\'s alright.'
print(txt) 

txt = "This will insert one \\ (backslash)."
print(txt) 

txt = "Hello\nWorld!"
print(txt) 

txt = "Hello\rWorld!"
print(txt) 

txt = "Hello\tWorld!"
print(txt) 

#This example erases one character (backspace):
txt = "Hello \bWorld!"
print(txt) 

#A backslash followed by three integers will result in a octal value:
txt = "\110\145\154\154\157"
print(txt) 

#A backslash followed by an 'x' and a hex number represents a hex value:
txt = "\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f"
print(txt)
